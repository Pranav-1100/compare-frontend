# compare-frontend

This is frontend for the same backend (https://github.com/Pranav-1100/compare) I uploaded, to experience my project just clone both the repos and then to run the backend get refer to this repo Readme.md ([https://github.com/Pranav-1100/compare](https://github.com/Pranav-1100/compare)) and for frontend after cloning just run these commands, First run the backend repo and then use these commands,

npm install

npm run dev

After that just go to localhost it is running on (you can refer to your terminal to know about the localhost it is running on to) and experience it :D.
